	<h5>We had to create a telegram channel for SteemPayout for the following reasons: </h5>
	
	<ol>
	<li> We feel it would not be a bad idea to encourage discussions among members. </li>
   <li> We also felt members might want to share certain information about steem as a whole, one which could be beneficial to another user on the steempayout platform. </li>
  <li>   In cases where certain user(s) find it hard to understand some features on the steempayout Platform, they could have a support community where they can ask questions and get help. </li>
  <li>   Most importantly, we felt there is a need for users to have an open market place where they can make certain currency exchange. </li>
  
  </ol>
