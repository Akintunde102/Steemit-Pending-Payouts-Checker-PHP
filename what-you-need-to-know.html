    SteemPayout helps steem users calculate their earnings on the steem blockchain automatically while taking into account conversions of theor steem dollars into fiat equivalnets in about 6 different currencies
</p>

<p> To learn more about how steempayout works, Read Below:</p>

<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-home"></span>Any Post made on the any steem-related website or application, is always stored on the steem blockchain. The steem blockchain and its content is open for anyone with the right programming skills or tools to access. 
</p>

<p>
As many websites and applications as possible, can be built on the steem blockchain. Examples of such websites and apps are steemit.com. chainbb.org, busy.org, d.tube.dlive.io and so on.
</p>

<p>
Any posts you make via any of these websites can be viewed from any of this applications and websites, unless when otherwise restricted. FOr instance, you can see all your steemit post on busy.org and vice versa while steemit posts can not be viewed on Utopian.io. This means Utopian.io only allows you to view posts made on their website.
</p>

<p>
On the steem blockchain, comments and posts are all regarded as `POSTS`, meaning , the payouts are calculated same way.
</p>

<p>
When you make a post on any of the websites built on the steem blockchain, the website may add themselves as a  beneficiary to your post, meaning they get a certain percentage of your post payout when the payout matures.
</p>

<p>
Every post payout gets divided between the voters (curators) and the author in a rough ratio of 3:1 with the author taking a 75% payout while the 25% is divided among curators based on the time and worth of vote given.
</p>

<p>
The Author's 75% payout is further split into two, with one half being given to you as Steem Power while the other half becomes your Steem Backed Dollars Deposit (SBD) & Steem
</p>

<p>
Every post payout gets paid to your steem wallet after 7 days of posting in form of SBD, STEEM, AND SP. 
</p>

<p>
SteemPayout helps you calculate the amount of SBD you will be receiving from the each post payout after any 7 day period while taking into consideration , beneficiary payout deduction.
</p>

<p>
Steempayout does not feature posts with  zero earnings 
</p>

<p>
Steempayout is open-source and is being consistently developed by <a href="https://steemit.com">@akintunde</a>
</p>

<hr/>
<p class="bold">Below Explains how SteemPayout Works in Detail</p>

<p>
The website has two major pages, a front page for searching usernames and a result page for viewing post payout analysis. 
</p>

<p>
The Result Page is also in two forms: The Post And Comment Section.
</p>

<p>
Post Section: This shows all the blogs a user makes on the steem blockchain while leaving out, posts that were reblogged (resteemed)
</p>

<p>

Comment Section: The Comment Section features all comments made by a user. It works just like the post section , only that the comment section is does not have a beneficiary column.
</p>

<hr/>
<p class="bold">

</p>
<p><b> Beneficiary : </b>  It shows the percentage of deduction and fiat/crypto-currency equivalent of each beneficiary's payout
</p>

<p>
    <b>Post link : </b> This shows the link to the post being analyzed
</p>

<p>
    <b>Pending Payout:</b> This shows the total payout of  a post, this can fluctuate indefinitely until payout, based on the market price of SBD
</p>

<p>
<b>Voter's list :</b> This contains the list of voters for each post, including the fiat/crypto-currency equivalent of their votes
</p>

<p>
<b>Withdrawal Time:</b> This contains a human friendly display of time left till payout
</p>
